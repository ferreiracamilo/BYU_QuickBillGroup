##file serves as a marker for the classes/ directory as a Python package

##If Init does not work for you, another alternative is placing code below at top of the file you're having issues at execution time

##import os
##import sys
##sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "..")))
